<h2 id="situation-and-task">Situation and Task</h2>

<p>As a Teaching Assistant Workshop Facilitator (TAWF), <strong>I demonstrated my oral communication skills when I delivered 2-hour long workshops to graduate students in the Fundamentals of University Teaching program</strong>. In my first term as a TAWF, I was given responsibility for a workshop on Teaching Methods. To effectively communicate workshop material in an engaging and memorable manner, and act as a teaching role model for learners, I was required to use my oral communication skills by using precise, clear, and appropriate language and pronunciation.</p>

<h2 id="my-actions">My Actions</h2>

<p>To develop the <strong>oral communication skills</strong> to effectively communicate the workshop materials in an engaging and memorable manner, <strong>I performed a self-appraialsal of my workshop delivery by recording videos of myself during practice sessions.</strong> These videos allowed me to assess my performance and help me to identify areas for improvement. This process highlighted that at times my voice would trail off at the end of a sentence, reducing the clarity of my speech. I also realized that although it felt as though I was enthusiastic in my delivery, at times I would fail to smile. This communicated to learners that I was not engaged with the material. To gauge whether I was using precise language, <strong>I performed parts of the workshop for a peer and asked them to repeat back the information that I had communicated to them.</strong> Through this activity, I identified that I was not clear when explaining some segments of the workshop. I realized that these flaws in my delivery were attributable to a lack of comfort with the workshop material. To remedy this, <strong>I wrote a script to help me ingrain workshop material in my mind.</strong></p>

<em>Practice session video recording.</em></p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p><strong>Using my oral commnication skills, I have successfully delivered five workshops to graduate students in the Centre for Teaching Excellence’s Fundamentals of University Teaching program</strong>. Instructor feedback forms completed by student participants have consistently rated the quality of the quality of the workshop facilitation as <em>Excellent</em>, with comments such as “Knowledgeable, confident. A+, thank you,” and “Funny guy, good presentation skills.” <strong>By taking the time to record my practice sessions and seek feedback from peers, I have been successful in developing my oral communication skills to effectively communicate workshop material in an engaging and memorable manner.</strong></p>
