<h2 id="situation-and-task">Situation and Task</h2>

<p><strong>I demonstrated my decision making skills</strong> when I designed a mixed-methods process and outcome evaluation to suit the needs of four health care organizations working in partnership to deliver a new model of coordinated care for frail older adults requiring post-acute and community rehabilitation. The four partner organizations that I worked with were required to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model of care in order to secure funding for the ongoing delivery of the program; however, each organization had a unique set of outcomes that they wished to measure as part of the program evaluation. <strong>I used my decision making skills by gathering information</strong> about the unique needs of each organization, <strong>presenting a series of potential</strong> evaluation questions and methodologies, and by <strong>listening to feedback</strong> from all organizations, <strong>creating an acceptable evaluation plan</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="my-actions">My Actions</h2>

<p>To gather information about the outcomes that each organization wanted to measure through the program evaluation, <strong>I facilitated a group brainstorming session</strong> at a program leadership committee meeting that had representation from each program partner organizations. Using a series of brainstorming questions that I developed, <strong>I generated a priority list</strong> of the outcomes that the group felt were most important to measure through the program evaluation. <strong>I then developed three evaluation plans</strong> that were based on a different mix of evaluation methodologies and instruments to address as many of the outcomes included on the priority list as possible. These evaluation plans differed with respect to the frequency that patients would receive a functional assessment and interview, whether patient families would also be interviewed, and the need for a contrast group for patients that did not have family that were involved in their care. To obtain feedback on each evaluation plan, <strong>I created a presentation</strong> that described each of the evaluation plans. <strong>I presented the evaluation plans</strong> at another leadership committee meeting and solicited feedback from each of the organizations in a round-table format. One of the organization leaders had concerns with one of the evaluation plans, as she did not believe that the there would not be sufficient power given the projected program sample size to demonstrate statistically significant results. Given that this option seemed most suitable to the members of the leadership committee, <strong>I suggested that I could follow-up</strong> with power calculations the following day. <strong>I completed these calculations</strong> and emailed the results to all members of the leadership committee to demonstrate the viability of this evaluation plan. After addressing all the group’s concerns, <strong>I made a decision</strong> on which evaluation plan to follow for the program evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I recently received full ethics clearance for the program evaluation and have started interviewing patients following the program evaluation plan that I designed. By asking each organization to describe their individual needs, presenting a series of potential evaluation plans, addressing concerns, and seeking approval from all program stakeholders, <strong>I was able to design an evaluation plan that would demonstrate the effectiveness of this new model of coordinated patient care</strong>. Through this experience, I learned the importance of speaking with all stakeholders that would be affected by a decision to ensure that their individual needs would be addressed. I believe that this situation clearly demonstrates my <strong>decision making skills by gathering information, presenting potential solutions, listening to feedback, and ultimately making a decision that was acceptable by all</strong>.</p>
