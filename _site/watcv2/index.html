<h2 id="situation-and-task">Situation and Task</h2>

<p>As a Teaching Assistant Workshop Facilitator (TAWF), <strong>I demonstrated my initiative skills when I independently redesigned a portion of a long-standing Centre for Teaching Excellence workshop</strong>. In my first term as a TAWF, I was given responsibility for a workshop on teaching methods with the expectation that I would use materials that had been developed by previous TAWFs. After delivering the workshop several times, based on feedback from learners, I recognized that the workshop failed to discuss the reasons why instructors should aim to incorporate <em>active</em> teaching methods into their lessons. Unfortunately due to extenuating circumstances, I was unable to meet with my supervising Instructional Developer to discuss these challenges prior to delivering my next workshop.</p>

<h2 id="my-actions">My Actions</h2>

<p>To redesign the workshop to include the missing content, <strong>I emailed two TAWFs that had previously delivered this Teaching Methods workshop</strong> to ask for their perspective on the feedback that I had received and to discuss potential solutions. Based on their input, <strong>I decided the best course of action</strong> would be to insert a slide that discussed the theoretical basis for <em>active</em> teaching methods. To ensure that the information I was communicating to students had a strong basis in pedagogy research, <strong>I performed a literature search</strong> for articles that summarized the prevailing theories behind <em>active</em> approaches to learning. <strong>I modified the workshop using information found in the literature review</strong>. After finishing this work, <strong>I emailed the two TAWFs</strong> that I consulted with previously to ask for their feedback on the changes that I had made. Although they were supportive of the changes, they recommended that I reduce the density of text on the slides. <strong>I followed their recommendations</strong> and integrated the changes into the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p><strong>I successfully delivered the modified workshop to a group of graduate students in the Centre for Teaching Excellence’s Fundamentals of University Teaching program</strong>. Although instructor feedback forms were not collected for this workshop, there were fewer questions from learners related to evidence supporting <em>active</em> teaching methods. This suggests that the modified workshop addressed a gap in learners’ understanding. Additionally, I was fortunate to have my supervising Instructional Developer in attendance for the workshop. During a short debrief meeting after the workshop, she voiced her support of the modified workshop and provided additional suggestions for further refinement. <strong>By taking the initiative to listen to student feedback, seek help from peers, and conduct my own review of the literature, I was successful in modifing the workshop to better meet learners’ needs.</strong></p>
