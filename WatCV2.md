# Initiative 

## Situation and Task

As a Teaching Assistant Workshop Facilitator (TAWF), **I demonstrated my initiative skills when I independently redesigned a portion of a long-standing Centre for Teaching Excellence workshop**. In my first term as a TAWF, I was given responsibility for a workshop on teaching methods with the expectation that I would use materials that had been developed by previous TAWFs. After delivering the workshop several times, based on feedback from learners, I recognized that the workshop failed to discuss the reasons why instructors should aim to incorporate *active* teaching methods into their lessons. Unfortunately due to extenuating circumstances, I was unable to meet with my supervising Instructional Developer to discuss these challenges prior to delivering my next workshop.

## My Actions

To redesign the workshop to include the missing content, **I emailed two TAWFs that had previously delivered this Teaching Methods workshop** to ask for their perspective on the feedback that I had received and to discuss potential solutions. Based on their input, **I decided the best course of action** would be to insert a slide that discussed the theoretical basis for *active* teaching methods. To ensure that the information I was communicating to students had a strong basis in pedagogy research, **I performed a literature search** for articles that summarized the prevailing theories behind *active* approaches to learning. **I modified the workshop using information found in the literature review**. After finishing this work, **I emailed the two TAWFs** that I consulted with previously to ask for their feedback on the changes that I had made. Although they were supportive of the changes, they recommended that I reduce the density of text on the slides. **I followed their recommendations** and integrated the changes into the workshop.

## Results

**I successfully delivered the modified workshop to a group of graduate students in the Centre for Teaching Excellence's Fundamentals of University Teaching program**. Although instructor feedback forms were not collected for this workshop, there were fewer questions from learners related to evidence supporting *active* teaching methods. This suggests that the modified workshop addressed a gap in learners' understanding. Additionally, I was fortunate to have my supervising Instructional Developer in attendance for the workshop. During a short debrief meeting after the workshop, she voiced her support of the modified workshop and provided additional suggestions for further refinement. **By taking the initiative to listen to student feedback, seek help from peers, and conduct my own review of the literature, I was successful in modifing the workshop to better meet learners' needs.**
